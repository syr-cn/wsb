78,Lazybopazy,"People playing the GME gambit should have stocks not options. Anyone with calls specifically playing this earnings call was very special indeed. 

Gamestops really interesting because as a business it's been slowly failing for years and it's stock price reflected a very bearish outlook but fundamentally the business has the cash money to survive for ages and there's a concerted effort to turn it around (rather than just sleepwalk it into the ground). If the stock price holds over 12 through this sell off there's a very really possibility that the stock will rebound to 15+ (just look at the peaks and troughs recently) in the coming weeks and then Q4 earnings could see them posting actually positive EPS and if GME is still a 'meme stonk' at that point it could pop off bigly off the back of that. I don't envisage a crazy short squeeze taking it to 5 batrillion $$$ but there's absolutely no reason that this stock can't go to 30+ just based on its revenue streams - if they can convince the market and consumers that they have a future in the digital space as well as a viable merch/niche brick and mortar operation.",1607468565,21,0

* AMD has solidified new support above $92, and is ready to keep going.
* AAPL, again support above $122, and is ready to keep going. Might consolidate around 123 tomorrow.

82,Turokk8001,"Seriously. 

Yeah it tanked AH but the earnings report and call are mostly great.  I am long on GME (1.5k shares plus a few 2021 calls) but I bought 12/11/20 puts because I expected it to drop.  Nobody thought 3Q earnings were going to be positive (or up from last year when COD was released in 3Q as opposed to this year when it came out in 4Q) but they beat the earnings estimates, significantly reduced costs, and are clearly listening to Cohen and pushing hard away from brick and mortar to having a bigger online presence.

The shelf offering is not great for people hoping for the short squeeze, assuming they take advantage of it, but $100m is not a huge amount of share dilution. Even if they used all of it, the short interest would still be at unprecedented levels.

GameStop apparently can't tell which orders were placed in store and which were with the backdoor link.

Rumor is they are now canceling all of the orders.

It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Companies like Steam, owned by the **Valve**, jumped into the web-based world by selling games entirely online. With its first-mover advantage, the company now commands [75% of the world‚Äôs PC games distribution](https://comparecamp.com/steam-statistics.).

GameStop, on the other hand, has been comfortable living in the past. **In 2013, the company s**[**uccessfully lobbied**](https://www.justpushstart.com/2013/06/gamestop-played-a-role-in-microsoft-reversing-drm-on-xbox-one/) **Microsoft (NASDAQ:**[**MSFT**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/)**) to ship its new Xbox One consoles with disc drives, prolonging the life of the used games business**. And in 2020, GME boldly announced a [multi-year strategic relationship](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft) with Microsoft that didn‚Äôt involve game distribution at all. Instead, a careful reader would have realized the partnership involved upgrading GameStop‚Äôs back-end to run Dynamics 365, Microsoft‚Äôs suite of cloud-based business services.

**Finally, you could simply sit back and watch GameStop burn.** While my heart goes out to the thousands of retail workers who will inevitably lose their jobs, my sympathy only goes so far up the food chain; GameStop‚Äôs top brass walked away with [$35.2 million in compensation last year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520120938/d878410ddefc14a.htm#toc878410_21), even as the company‚Äôs business model was collapsing.",1607991308,8,0

503,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Once again, Stimulus Talks are going well. Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.
* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).
* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many ""small"" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.
* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.
* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.
* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.
* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every ""tech"" IPO can be a winner.
* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.
* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to ""only"" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.
* DJI closed down 435 pts to 0.15%, IXIC at +0.50% thanks to AMZN and MSFT, while SPX is at +0.18%. **GME closed 0.00%**. Be on the lookout for stimulus news which should resolve by the end of this week. Market moving numbers tomorrow: housing starts/permits, jobless claims, and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index all at at 8:30 AM ET. Quad Witching this Friday, Dec 18. The last time WSB went-all in on Quad Witching cuz hur dur MMs wont pay out the puts was April earlier this year. It didn't pan out. But turns out we were right eventually but for all the wrong reason. The best kind of correct!",1608152585,91,2
504,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:


* AAPL aims for upping production on their flagship iPhone by 30% for 1st half of 2021 (based on #s from supliers) while JPMorgan sees 20% upside for them in 2021. Tim Apple gaps up and opens at 2%+ this morning with shares going as high as 4.52% intraday. The stock closed at $127.88, up a beefy 5%, level unseen since earlier this September.
* Meanwhile, the rest of big tech took an initial mini dump this morning while the indexes are solidly green cuz sEcToR roTAtiOn and stimulus hOpE but reversed to close mostly green (except for MSFT cuz hur dur MSFT $200c).
* Earlier today, Pelosi asked for McConnell, Schumer, and McCarthy to a 4pm meeting, while current Congressional plan calls for splitting the $948 billion bill into two parts, a $748b in spending programs that are popular for both parties and the 2nd $160b bill with liability protection and aid to state plus local govt. Stimulus checks are STILL not in current plans (rofl). But don't worry, that public ""small business"" with a few thousand employees (not in same location) will no doubt be able to easily access forgivable PPP loans in the coming weeks!
* Cramer talked about WSB today via a segment on TheStreet and WSB proceed to jizz over itself uncontrollably because one old bald dude talking mildly positive about WSB is *just* like the opposite sex touching our genital. This is what #WINNING in 2020 looks like, bois.
* Chinese EV ADR/ADS jump bigly today thanks to who the fuck knows why, with XPEV at intraday high of 7.82%, NIO at 6.1%, LI at almost 5%, and KN-DI at 3%. The EV meme stocks all closed in positive territory despite pulling back from initial highs.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR pulled back 2.97%, continuing in current channel while WSB triples down because ThIS iS a $50 sToNk. DBX, a new play by select WSBer ended the day red but don't worry, an acquisition news is just around the corner before your 12/18s expire worthless. Finally, GME is up 8.88%, likely buoyant by today's NPD report showing 35% increase in YoY November gaming spending thanks to the new gen console cycle release.
* The Dow closed up more than 338 pts to 1.13%, Nasdaq up 155 pts to 1.25%, and S&amp;P up 47 pts to 1.29%. Will stimulus arrive? As Pelosi said by EOD: ""We'll see.""
* Tons of market moving events tomorrow: 8:30 AM retail sales, 9:45 AM PMI, business inventories and housing market index at 10:00 AM, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and finally Jpow speaks tomorrow at 2:30 PM ET after FOMC release at 2:00 PM.

623,beefstake,"Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.",1608413558,21,0

On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m.

The stock went up 500% and it could've possibly gone EVEN HIGHER but Porsche decided to sell 5% of VW's stock so shorts could cover.

Popular expiry includes calls after April given that'll bake in the much touted Q4 ER period where new console cycle sale numbers will be revealed. WSB eagerly awaits for GME call bro to post his next update. Back of envelop math should have our bro back up about 800k at the very least. GME close the day up 25% to $19.46.
* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.
* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer ""tech/internet"" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.
* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.
* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20
* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.
* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.
* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.
* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET. No interesting ER this week tho Paychex does report BMO on Wednesday morning.

706,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.

794,telperiontree,"So, you aren't getting it. As long as Cohen owns 10% or more of the company - 10% or more of the stock - he can do a takeover. Before today, he owned 9% of the company. The board of directors collectively shat their pants Q3 earnings over it, threatening to issue 100 million dollars worth of new shares. Not 100 million shares, 100 million dollars worth of shares. 

They were trying to prevent Cohen from doing a Hostile  takeover. 

Today, Cohen bought up to 12.9 percent of the company and filed with the SEC. He owns 9,001,000 shares. 9,001,000/.129 means GME has 69,775,194 shares total. For 9,001,000 to be less than 10 percent, GME would need 90,010,000 shares. That means they would need to issue over 20 million shares. 

GME would have to be less than 5 bucks a share for them to be able to issue 100 million dollars worth of shares and successfully fend off Cohen. 

That's impossible, so they aren't going to issue shares. It wouldn't do anything but piss everyone off more and make it even easier for Cohen to fire them, while making them poorer. 

If they are that fucktarded or spiteful for whatever reason, the stock short term dips, we all buy more like flies on shit, Cohen takes over and fires them all, then we moon. 

Tl;dr:

825,whatisliquidity,"&gt;This is why their Microsoft deal was so important, when gamestop sells new xbox's it gets a share what that console downloads. Microsoft needs to sell as many consoles as it can for their own success, they don't have a network of physical stores or a desire to sell direct to customers.

I think you're overvaluing their Microsoft deal. It essentially amounts to them using Microsoft hardware and software in exchange for a small kickback. Microsoft does have physical stores and has no issues dealing with retail but lacks the desire for that infrastructure especially when they can go direct to digital at less then a 100th of cost.

&gt;This was game changing, the surge in share price after this announcement reflects that.

The surge represented squeeze interest being bought and a potential pivot to the 21st century. Cohen is a much bigger catalyst. 

&gt;Now Sony and Nintendo haven't ruled out a similar deal, and dealing with all retailers in the same way will protect all their collective futures, I wouldn't bet on a deal, but making some sort of deal makes a lot of sense for all parties, they need each other.

I agree they're useful for each other but Sony releasing a new gen console without a drive is a wake up call for GME. They'd better pick up the pace of the shorts will win.",1609008807,1,0

As for dropping B&amp;M completely, and it might be my age talking, but Gamestop is a swapshop to me.

Unfortunately we have not done a great job of manufactuering 1 or 2 in an online setting and while I think that maybe GME can pioneer 1 algorithms tend to not be able to be written to cover point 2. 

You'll never ""discover"" anything new again. It's kind of like reading Moody's vs. going to WSB; you don't discover new stocks here, not really, instead you just coalesce on other people's discoveries but the question is where do you go to get the frontier news and be a first adopter?

-If you‚Äôre looking for a good idea read. 
-Or if you don‚Äôt think I will go bust tell my why! 

FACTS: 

1. Stimulus Package; market already priced it in and Trump is taking another Dump on it. If he doesn‚Äôt sign it by midnight tonight FUCK!!!

2. GA Senate Run-Off Elections; only a few weeks away and since the Nov elections the market pumped hard with the expectation of a divided Gov‚Äôt (Republican‚Äôs taking the senate).  May still happen but odds aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they did a month ago. 

3. Peaceful Transition of Power; we can all agree Donnie is unhinged. He only plays golf and tweets how the election was rigged and doesn‚Äôt seem he will ever concede.  

4. COVID; all the vaccine news is priced in however infections and fatalities just keep trending upwards.  

5. Regardless if you are a BULL or BEAR think we can all agree the market is fk‚Äôing expensive.  Specially the Russell 2K &amp; NASDAQ. 

- Russell 2000; last week rose above 2000 for the first time ever and is up over 35% just in the last 3 months.  

-NASDAQ; only 200 points from 13K which I think will touch next week. However once it does it will retract as it has done so every time it reaches a new 1K milestone. 10K, 11K, 12K etc. 

No I‚Äôm not a fucking bear but do think too much good news has been priced and the market is looking for any excuse to pull back.  

Solution: VOLATILITY my weapon of choice UVXY however you can pick your fav. 

UVXY PRICE FUN FACTS: 
1. $10.77 Wednesday closing price. 
1A. $10.58 (12/08) 52 WEEK LOW MKT CLOSE.
1B. $10.26 (12/09) 52 WEEK LOW INTRA DAY. 

2. $13.30 (12/21) last week high, this past Monday when the futures took a dump due to the new covid strain.  BTW that was a 21% PUMP which the market later on ignored.  

3. $21.60 (10/30) just to days prior to the presidential election.  
3A. UVXY has lost over 50% of it‚Äôs value since the last election.  

4. OPTION IV &amp; PUMP: 
4A. Feb 19th $10 CALLS over 150% current price $270 
4B. Same CALL (12/21 from 10am to 10:45am) $890.  Held 10 calls sold 5. 

Wednesday just before market closed laid over $50K across a number of strike prices and expirations.   

Nothing is a guarantee however I would much rather bet on this vs any of the exhausted stonks.   I don‚Äôt doubt GME, QS, TESLA, PLUG etc etc will continue to pump however on the short term the probability is they need to retract before they keep pumping.   BTW; for me to double the 50K I only need the UVXY to go up to $13.27 (ASK YOURSELF DO YOU THINK WE COULD SEE SOME VOLATILITY IN THE NEXT 2-4 WEEKS?  And even if we don‚Äôt and we get even better news volatility can only lose 2-3% before we reach a new 52 week low.

This is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it‚Äôll come next week), and then the conference. 

They also probably don‚Äôt want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum.

1057,Poodogmillionaire,"Everyone was wondering when they would be able to buy in after it went above $20, worried they wouldn‚Äôt get the chance. Well the answer is NOW. I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn‚Äôt want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we‚Äôve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in‚Äôs by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don‚Äôt let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price.

Be sure to form at least a basic understanding before jumping in with real money, and when you do jump in, start with small option plays.

If you want to join in, you would either: buy calls, sell puts, or buy shares (less risk).   Be warned, calls, puts and all other option plays can and do expire worthless.  Shares may decrease in value, but other than the company getting delisted it's improbable that you would lose all of your initial investment.  Of course the downside is, you won't have as much upside.  Even the best traders lose, but they are smart enough to not have bet everything on it.

cult stocks are crazy tbh   üòî

what advantage is there from buying games from GME?

if i want a console or physical games, i can go to AMZN, WMT or BBY (latter two have brick and mortar locations if you're into that sort of thing)

if i want digital games, i can download directly from xbox live, PSN store, steam, etc.

if i want mobile games, i download from my phone

But I think more than that he's been studying companies like Amazon and looking for how to do better. Amazon is amazing at a few things, like free and fast delivery and being a one stop shop for...everything. But Amazon does NOT have great customer service. They also have a real and growing problem with sellers. Sold and shipped by Amazon? Cool, no worries there. Literally any other seller? It could be a Chinese knockoff and there's no way to know.


I think Cohen knows that GME can easily compete in delivery by using retail locations, customer service is his trademark, and he won't allow anyone else to sell on their platform.

IMO he's moving towards PC gaming - that way he can use the relationship with Microsoft (who don't forget are arguably the biggest firm in terms of computing), to create a monster in that area. Don't forget he now follows those 2 PC magazines/ websites

1481,Laughingboy14,"üöÄüöÄüöÄ - GME is going to $100

My only issue is that market cap weighted passive funds tend to not actually buy that much more when market cap goes up. This is because as market cap goes up, share price rises, so index funds automatically balance themselves (I.e. without needing to purchase more). 

Passive funds only really buy more when a) they're open funds that have to deploy more capital b) the company is entered into more indexes.

Listen Lads, 

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, ‚ÄúMoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee‚Äù ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don‚Äôt think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say ‚ÄúGood men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground‚Äù as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat‚ÄîLions and Hyenas. 

These Lions‚Äîthese Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there‚Äôs us‚Äîthe lowly Hyenas‚Äîretail‚Äîthe working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We‚Äôre ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US ‚ÄúDUMB‚Äù MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them ‚ÄúLike, how do you have so much moneyyy?‚Äù 

You know what they say? 

They reply: ‚ÄúHaha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money‚Äù





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He‚Äôs called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He‚Äôs congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He‚Äôs congratulated WSB on the ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù (implying that little thing, was it‚Äîhoping we‚Äôll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they‚Äôre cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They‚Äôre all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I‚Äôve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I‚Äôm throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I‚Äôm fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain‚Äôt so dumb anymore...

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  üßªü§ö running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.

The Double Barrel Boomer Suplex^TM is on the table, we have 2 more days until calls hit, $115 on friday could mean atomic rocket fuel juicier than your husband's girlfriends sweatpants. It's looking alot like we're poised to dramatically exceed this mark, forget the üåö, we're gonna find some üëΩ putang over in andromeda while we sip our tendie cocktail. If this is the case, $1000 is not a meme but the strength of üíéüëê's will determine if more is. 

$1000 would be a victory, it would mean student debts payed, downpayments placed, future investments made, luxuries enjoyed and burdens lightened. We are owed this and more after all these leeches have done to ensure we are kept under their boots. They use the media to vilify us because we are crawling our way out, we, the lowly retail trader and are beating them at their own game.

They know they cant stop us now, the only hope left for them is us letting up before we realize the full value of our holdings. $1000 would change alot of lives, but if you've come to beleive in GME's future prospects and the strength of üíéüëê's you know this is not it's full value. The demand is available for anyone to see, if you want to supply below the curve that's on you but you'll only be helping the people whod see you drown under the rising tide. 

You want to see this system change? you want a better future? You want your children to succeed? Do you wana build a real trickle down economy? Then get your üíéüëê's fucking ready and show these üåàüêª's you know what you're fucking worth!

1925,Rake-7613,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people don‚Äôt think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don‚Äôt want credit I just don‚Äôt want the little guy to lose!

1928,urnewfamousceleb,"30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî&gt; price goes down ‚Äî&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî&gt; price drops even more ‚Äî&gt; they keep doing that ‚Äî&gt; price drops lower every time ‚Äî&gt; but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is a game of morale, a war of attrition. WALL STREET, MELVIN, HEDGE FUNDS, MARKET MAKERS ARE BETTING ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN. THEY ARE BETTING ON US HAVING PAPER HANDS. THEY ARE SEEING BUY AND HOLD AND THINKING THEY CAN CALL OUR BLUFF

They haven't won. They pulled a dirty, illegal cheap shot, yes. But they wouldn't have done that if they were winning. This ship is still sailing, and will continue to do so as long people HOLD, BUY, and HOLD some more.

Let's not push this victim narrative, let's not allow law suits, angry tweets, and other stocks to distract us. Doing so sews a subconscious sentiment that we have already lost. They want us to take our eye off the ball.

THEY WANT US TO TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE BALL. GME IS THE BALL. BUY IT AND HOLD IT. END OF STORY.

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:

‚ÄúRobinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his company‚Äôs motto of ‚Äúdemocratizing finance for all‚Äù by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States‚Äô foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve what‚Äôs left of the American democracy.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this, it may not be the first time you‚Äôre seeing it but I am sending it to reach as many as I can.

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise.

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses.

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. When studying history (at some point we‚Äôve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions.

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in.

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals? Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around.

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society.

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings.

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‚Äòwork culture‚Äô that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable.

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it.

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over.

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play.

Ignore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your üíé üôå I am not an investment manager, I am but a humble dumbass who really likes this stock üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1611926278,3555,21

* GME tested new support above $16, which means its ready to keep rolling tomorrow. Also kinda looks like a lop sided cup n handle.
* PLTR, SPCE, TSLA all broke out today, so they will need to trade sideways before moving higher, likely continuing their rise on Wednesday/Thursday.
* AMD has solidified new support above $92, and is ready to keep going.
* AAPL, again support above $122, and is ready to keep going. Might consolidate around 123 tomorrow.
* NVDA just established support at $540, and is ready to roll past $550.
* CRM has established a recovery trend the last three days after the earnings sell off.

I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you‚Äôre boarding a rocket).  I'm holding the all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I‚Äôll know pretty soon.  

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen‚Äôs Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that‚Äôs early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you‚Äôre right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the ‚ÄúChewy-fication‚Äù of GameStop ‚Äì efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn‚Äôt like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn‚Äôt like Sherman‚Äôs focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he‚Äôs made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He‚Äôs saying: Don‚Äôt you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn‚Äôt do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman‚Äôs fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs got the eye of the tiger, he‚Äôs still in that young and crushing it phase. He‚Äôs got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he‚Äôs going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He‚Äôs watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company‚Äîthe moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he‚Äôs going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn‚Äôt know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen‚Äôs attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It‚Äôs go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call ‚Äì one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it‚Äôs a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you‚Äôre out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?

Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don‚Äôt Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It‚Äôs almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I‚Äôm guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman‚Äôs incentives ‚Äì financial, ego ‚Äì point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn‚Äôt take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that‚Äôs coming to him. But even though I‚Äôd jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I‚Äôm guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren‚Äôt hard see here.  We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.

&gt;How does it work? Lets say a new X Box X costs $499, the typical margin is around 10% so that is $50. However, what if a customer takes a monthly package such as the All Access package and doesn‚Äôt pay up front for the console and can access games from the cloud : https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access#findaretailer that is $35 per month. So that is estimated to be a 10% rev share with GameStop at $3.5 per month which will be $84 margin over 2 years instead of a one off of $49. When you start considering $25bn or $30bn of total sales over a console cycle that becomes really significant. 5 million XBox X passes could be $210mn of pure margin per year for 2 years.

It could be a multitude of reasons why they are closing however. Anecdotal reply, my city has a population of 200k, we have 3 Gamestops. All spread out, all by different major hubs/shopping centers, none of them have closed through this closure, which makes me assume that the 3 stores we have are doing well, all things considered. Given the opportunity to run a large B&amp;M, cutting expenses and liabilities is a long term, good idea.
Secondly, inventory volume of PS5/XBsX/XBsS. This is the unknown. How does Sony and Microsoft distribute to each store? Is it a set amount, and then the retailer distributes to the location? Or is it ""each store open gets 5 consoles per shipment.""if its the latter, then its not a good decision, if it the prior example, which is the example I would put money on. Then that just means each store gets more inventory, thus creating more excitement at one store, drawing a larger crowd to buy even more knick-knacks from gme.",1607872302,1,0

PS5 won't be far behind if they don't already have something like this. The industry is moving to the monthly subscriber model and all games are purchased digitally now. You can even gift people digital games in the Microsoft store. GME was a brick and mortar distributor and existed to help fill a gap that doesn't exist anymore. 

They literally bring no value to the market. Guaranteed to crumble into a niche retro gaming website. You are all fucking stupid.",1607874559,1,0

GME is great if you're theta gang. Buy commons, sell CC against them. Generate huge returns p.a with little risk considering it's trading at such a low valuation right now.

Note that GameStop does not have to beat Amazon at all (like many here think) to blast off to the moon. The company is insanely undervalued in terms of market cap, it just has to stay afloat (which is almost guaranteed given their financials and huge boost from the concole cycle) and find it's own niche in this huge gaming market.

People mistakenly assume two things:

1) **Everyone is buying digital:** not really true. Tons of people have crappy internet, consoles have very limited storage. And sometimes folks like to own something physical (myself included) - I still buy paper books despite having 4 devices to read from (Kindle is one of them).

Also, this point is even less relevant considering the fact of digital sales revenue sharing with Microsoft and rumors of similar agreements with Sony.

2). **GameStop only sells games on CDs / Will always sell CDs.** Haven't been true for a while, and lots of new directions they can take it to; gaming equipment, at the very least. Think Chewy for gaming (this is where our boy Ryan Cohen comes in)

On top of that sprinkle some insanely huge short interest (128%) playing as an insane upwards pushing force and you get a risky bet but with an insane reward potential.

Also, just a sidenote: a company with absolutely no revenue that makes EV renders and rolls trucks downhill has 6.6x market cap of GME, let that sink in.",1608376277,2,0

If it keeps rising they'll eventually be margin called and forced to double down or close their position. If they close their position it increases GME stock price and we get a positive feedback cycle of shorters closing positions and hopefully the Volkswagen infinity squeeze,1608402281,33,0
3116,_MN_Fun_,"Price targets are all just fantasy. It‚Äôs not the same as VW, could be better, could be worse. Everyone has the facts thanks to the DD here. You are basically in or out to find out. Everyone, bulls, bears, big positions, small positions, all agree, there needs to be a shift of some sort to adapt and change the story of GME. That‚Äôs when we will find out.",1608413301,27,0
3117,beefstake,"Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.",1608413558,21,0

On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m. The feed backloop exists, and its just going to take one major positive catalyst to set it all off, in my opinion.",1608413416,19,0

GME has a concentrated short position (BoA, Melvin) against a large number of longs.  1 to 1 short to float ratio.

There definitely are long term shorts who are in it for the goose egg but that's not all of them. Some got in because they thought COVID was going to end GME. As it becomes more clear that's not going to happen you can expect more covering.

When Q4 comes in at +30% yoy you can expect more and more covering as the reality of GME having a lot of time to pivot sets in. If they make even more progress on Omnichannel (it just means online sales guys, that's all) then expect the floodgates of covering to open. 

If GME is doing well enough to threaten to reinstate its dividend that can also get some shorts to capitulate. The time horizon for a short gets dramatically compressed if they have to pay a dividend too. It would also be a display of confidence by the board.

I've said it before, I've never seen a better setup for tendies in my entire life. Short positions are about to get hammered again and again by good news.

Lastly, if you're inclined to buy or to yolo, no need to rush. There will be down days or down weeks. The ER may have been the best entry but maybe not, stand ready to buy the dips.

I have a calendar spread covered strangle 1/2022 and 1/2023 expiry. -30C and -5P. Premiums stupid high thanks to GME meme stock status, brought my cost basis down to $7.50 when purchased @ $12.72.

Basically, as long as we stay above $7.50 I'm a very happy camper.

But, the play here is the turnaround. I'd just pull this out my ass: gaming hardware, equipments and accessories, consoles once every few years, cybersport involvement, selling merchandise, action figures, collectibles and shit. Not to mention revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft (confirmed) and Sony (rumored). Basically, if the company manages to find a way to stay relevant in any sense, to capture just a teeny-tiny part of this enormous and rapidly growing market - we'd have a 10x bagger on our hands.


The sweetest thing is they are perfectly positioned to make this change - paying back their debts, strong financials (especially so for a retailer during covid). I just can't see how can they go bankrupt for at least a few more years sans something catastrophic happening. I see them being on a right track - closing underperforming &amp; inefficient stores, getting that deal with Microsoft, trying to remake their app and website (they've just recently started offering same-day delivery with DoorDash)

You are judging the company by your anecdotal gaming experience. The thing is, despite all the hate they get from hardcore gamers, they consistently make revenue multiples of their market cap. Most of GME bears I see assume that the company has to be the next hot thing, like Chewy, or Sony, or Steam or smth like Amazon. It does not - it may develop that way, it may not, but just staying afloat and being barely profitable is enough for the stock to rise significantly - check out their revenue and market cap, and compare to their competitors.

3214,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.

3242,telperiontree,"So, you aren't getting it. As long as Cohen owns 10% or more of the company - 10% or more of the stock - he can do a takeover. Before today, he owned 9% of the company. The board of directors collectively shat their pants Q3 earnings over it, threatening to issue 100 million dollars worth of new shares. Not 100 million shares, 100 million dollars worth of shares. 

They were trying to prevent Cohen from doing a Hostile  takeover. 

Today, Cohen bought up to 12.9 percent of the company and filed with the SEC. He owns 9,001,000 shares. 9,001,000/.129 means GME has 69,775,194 shares total. For 9,001,000 to be less than 10 percent, GME would need 90,010,000 shares. That means they would need to issue over 20 million shares. 

GME would have to be less than 5 bucks a share for them to be able to issue 100 million dollars worth of shares and successfully fend off Cohen. 

That's impossible, so they aren't going to issue shares. It wouldn't do anything but piss everyone off more and make it even easier for Cohen to fire them, while making them poorer. 

If they are that fucktarded or spiteful for whatever reason, the stock short term dips, we all buy more like flies on shit, Cohen takes over and fires them all, then we moon.

Cohen taking over = moon
It's now impossible for them to prevent him from taking over

3458,Anonymous_Stork,"What I remember : 
 - there are super bullish markets where everyone is making money with meme stocks and it feels like nothing can do down, and there are bearish markets where everyone is super depressed. Both eventually end and sometimes people get wiped because of that
 - pick good stocks that basically you can buy and never check their value again for 10 years and still sleep like a baby (ideally, stocks that go for less than the value of the assets)
 - dont get cocky and try to time the market, but you should buy stocks that are cheap at the moment
 - any move that is not 100% thought through is speculation. You should only speculate a tiny portion of your portfolio and separate that from your investments
 - do between 25% stocks / 75% bonds and 25% bonds / 75% stocks

3514,whatisliquidity,"&gt;This is why their Microsoft deal was so important, when gamestop sells new xbox's it gets a share what that console downloads. Microsoft needs to sell as many consoles as it can for their own success, they don't have a network of physical stores or a desire to sell direct to customers.

I think you're overvaluing their Microsoft deal. It essentially amounts to them using Microsoft hardware and software in exchange for a small kickback. Microsoft does have physical stores and has no issues dealing with retail but lacks the desire for that infrastructure especially when they can go direct to digital at less then a 100th of cost.

&gt;This was game changing, the surge in share price after this announcement reflects that.

The surge represented squeeze interest being bought and a potential pivot to the 21st century. Cohen is a much bigger catalyst. 

&gt;Now Sony and Nintendo haven't ruled out a similar deal, and dealing with all retailers in the same way will protect all their collective futures, I wouldn't bet on a deal, but making some sort of deal makes a lot of sense for all parties, they need each other.

I agree they're useful for each other but Sony releasing a new gen console without a drive is a wake up call for GME. They'd better pick up the pace of the shorts will win.",1609008807,1,0

You went in for two reasons: 1. to sell or swap a thing for another thing and 2. to discover something random in a bin. Unfortunately we have not done a great job of manufactuering 1 or 2 in an online setting and while I think that maybe GME can pioneer 1 algorithms tend to not be able to be written to cover point 2. 

You'll never ""discover"" anything new again. It's kind of like reading Moody's vs. going to WSB; you don't discover new stocks here, not really, instead you just coalesce on other people's discoveries but the question is where do you go to get the frontier news and be a first adopter?

-If you‚Äôre looking for a good idea read. 
-Or if you don‚Äôt think I will go bust tell my why! 

FACTS: 

1. Stimulus Package; market already priced it in and Trump is taking another Dump on it. If he doesn‚Äôt sign it by midnight tonight FUCK!!!

2. GA Senate Run-Off Elections; only a few weeks away and since the Nov elections the market pumped hard with the expectation of a divided Gov‚Äôt (Republican‚Äôs taking the senate).  May still happen but odds aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they did a month ago. 

3. Peaceful Transition of Power; we can all agree Donnie is unhinged. He only plays golf and tweets how the election was rigged and doesn‚Äôt seem he will ever concede.  

4. COVID; all the vaccine news is priced in however infections and fatalities just keep trending upwards.  

5. Regardless if you are a BULL or BEAR think we can all agree the market is fk‚Äôing expensive.  Specially the Russell 2K &amp; NASDAQ. 

- Russell 2000; last week rose above 2000 for the first time ever and is up over 35% just in the last 3 months.  

-NASDAQ; only 200 points from 13K which I think will touch next week. However once it does it will retract as it has done so every time it reaches a new 1K milestone. 10K, 11K, 12K etc. 

No I‚Äôm not a fucking bear but do think too much good news has been priced and the market is looking for any excuse to pull back.  

Solution: VOLATILITY my weapon of choice UVXY however you can pick your fav. 

UVXY PRICE FUN FACTS: 
1. $10.77 Wednesday closing price. 
1A. $10.58 (12/08) 52 WEEK LOW MKT CLOSE.
1B. $10.26 (12/09) 52 WEEK LOW INTRA DAY. 

2. $13.30 (12/21) last week high, this past Monday when the futures took a dump due to the new covid strain.  BTW that was a 21% PUMP which the market later on ignored.  

3. $21.60 (10/30) just to days prior to the presidential election.  
3A. UVXY has lost over 50% of it‚Äôs value since the last election.  

4. OPTION IV &amp; PUMP: 
4A. Feb 19th $10 CALLS over 150% current price $270 
4B. Same CALL (12/21 from 10am to 10:45am) $890.  Held 10 calls sold 5. 

Wednesday just before market closed laid over $50K across a number of strike prices and expirations.   

Nothing is a guarantee however I would much rather bet on this vs any of the exhausted stonks.   I don‚Äôt doubt GME, QS, TESLA, PLUG etc etc will continue to pump however on the short term the probability is they need to retract before they keep pumping.   BTW; for me to double the 50K I only need the UVXY to go up to $13.27 (ASK YOURSELF DO YOU THINK WE COULD SEE SOME VOLATILITY IN THE NEXT 2-4 WEEKS?  And even if we don‚Äôt and we get even better news volatility can only lose 2-3% before we reach a new 52 week low.

Your comment is basically assuming that there is one guy who holds all the shares that is telling shorts that the shares aren't for sale, that there is no ask price.

When VW squoze, Porsche held over 42% of outstanding VW shares.  They, alone, had a much higher influence on the price at which shorts could close.

If you enter a collar and the underlying goes downsies, you lose money. Period. 

If you enter a collar and the underlying goes uppies, you make money. Period.

You would call that ""very bearish"" position? You can perform all the stupid ass mental gymnastics that you want to believe that a hedge makes your entire position ""very bearish"" as you put it...but its just false. At no point do you want your underlying to move down in a collar.

3679,NothingTard,"To be honest, I took some small gains from watching you retards pump GME, so I don't have hate for it.

I'm not trying to be associated with dumbasses like you and OverpricedButthole. 

Ever since the retarded ""short squeeze"" bullshit, GMEtards have just been insufferable pricks. And regulars in this subreddit can tell from the aggressive shit talking and ghetto lexicon, (and the fact that they have been outed), that there is an outsider crew at the center of this. 

So yeah, ill buy more calls when GME crashes again to take advantage of the momentum stupidity can create, but for both my beliefs about their future and the negativity of the GME crew, I'm not making any big plays with them.

Every video game will *not* be digital due to data caps and download speeds. 

Being so shorted adds the squeeze potential. GME has been circling the drain for years but *that is no longer the case*. Whoever is stuck in that mindset will lose out. 

If you really don‚Äôt know what changed with GME since Covid hit, you‚Äôve clearly done no research. Ryan Cohen buying in this summer and applying pressure for a modern business model, and then GME following that model and RC buying *more* is a very bullish case for this company to pull out of its multi-year dive. 

The contract with MSFT is hopefully just the beginning. Sony and Nintendo may feel the pressure to make similar deals while GME wants to expand online. There will continue to be physical stores as distribution centers and if hard copies of games are on the decline, there‚Äôs plenty of room in the gaming industry to expand with other products.

3799,SentineL-EX,"I went to grad school to learn how to be a quant. I knew next to nothing about mathematical finance going in but I did a little research just to beef up my application letter (because no school will look favorably on you for telling the truth, ""I want this degree so I can get into a career that pays a lot of money""). The whole program is about pricing options, futures and other derivatives, plus a few courses/seminars that expose you to the kind of people/things you can expect on Wall Street.

I started the program in September 2018, and right around that time I heard PredictIt in the news. This was around the time of Kavanaugh's hearing, and since I thought his chances were good (market gave him a 48% chance right after Christine Ford testified) $20 on him. After Kav gave his own testimony it went to the high 70's and I walked out with $30. I also put $10 on Jair Bolsonaro becoming President of Brazil, which I honestly forget why. Probably read his Wikiquote page. But I held that to expiration and also made some money.

What really set me off was finding out that PI ran a weekly tweet market on Trump tweets (you have to predict, to the nearest 5-10, how many times he would tweet for the week). Figured out an arbitrage strategy (""negative risk"") that due to the mechanics of the site would deposit cold hard cash into your account. Not a glitch, just taking advantage of market inefficiency. Ended up pocketing maybe $25 a week until I had enough of a bank to make directional bets. If you follow Donnie long enough you start to pick up on patterns and can usually make an educated guess on where the winning bracket will be. I even wrote a paper exploring some strategies as my master's thesis (one strategy survived the test of time; the rest fell apart pretty quickly a few months after I published the paper).

In the meantime I saw a PI reference on WSB and I was hooked. This was one of the first posts I remember seeing on this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8s08ap/step_4_buy_stock_step_5_what_is_the_stock_market/. Slowly I went from being scared of investing my 1k in the middle of that late 2018 downturn to screwing around with two-figure options (OTM GE put iirc) to getting more and more ballsy. 

Fast forward to now and I have a six-figure sum across two portfolios - my buy and hold is full of 3x funds, still based around the strategy I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce7f4e/the_wsb_guide_to_index_funds_a_buy_and_hold/, and I dedicate 5-10% of my Robinhood funds on fucking around with options. Currently riding the PLTR/GME rockets. Made out like a bandit in March because I listened to Mister Metokur and he was full on panic mode about the coronavirus January/February. Rode puts all the way down and sold them once I realized the green days were a bit too green late March.

YTD up 45% on Robinhood and 51% on M1. Whenever I think that's a lot I look at the gain porn on here and realize that there are some places where even I'm a conservative investor. WSB made me a lot richer and the bantz on here made me a lot happier. Thanks frens",1609105756,3,0

Your post assumes that a short squeeze can happen only under one condition: lack of liquidity. You say that 15 million of shares are traded every day of GME which means liquidity is just fine and they have nothing to worry about. But those may be the same shares circulating over and over, while Ryan, Sherman (since he can't sell his shares due to Ryan's stake) and us and possibly other players are bagholding. Overall, we have to have like 30% of shares combined.

 15m shares a day, 25% of the stock, is traded every day. Okay, great. But literally on any good news at all, GME will go up. A million scenarios can be favorable to GME, while only one benefits üåàüêª: that GME will go bankrupt. Speaking of probability, on any good news, people will start to catch on, people will get in on the hype = less shares in circulation. The cycle will repeat. How are shorts supposed to cover 130%, paying daily interest, when 30% of shares and potentially more in the future are locked off, forever? Like 50%, 75% of shares at most can exchange hands on any given day but they can't cover everything since a large portion of people will just refuse to sell. Liquidity only goes so far without the price pumping.

Second of all, a short squeeze like VW is very unlikely to happen again, short of a miracle event. Why? Because people expect it. Maybe retail will buy into something that's likely to short squeeze but I doubt an institution doesn't remember the burn of VW. They will avoid it at all costs. By this logic, a short squeeze can only happen under different market conditions.


You sound intelligent, you analyse the market like a professional. Which means, hedge funds out there are staking it all on similar logic. They short GME because liquidity is high, so surely, for you guys, it can't be a repeat of VW. That's the gotcha. That's why nobody is panicking yet. And that's why GME actually has a chance to squeeze.


Anyway why do I bother typing this out though if noone on this sub can read

3957,Poodogmillionaire,"Everyone was wondering when they would be able to buy in after it went above $20, worried they wouldn‚Äôt get the chance. Well the answer is NOW. I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn‚Äôt want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we‚Äôve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in‚Äôs by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don‚Äôt let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price.

**What we learned at earnings:** 

1. They beat estimates on EPS. 
2. Revenue down YoY in Q3 (expected) but up in Nov YoY (expected)
3. Cash increased to $600MM which is greater than their short-term and long-term debt. 
4. They *may* offer more shares. Giving themselves the option to (i.e. take advantage of the squeeze if the thing skyrockets and they want to use the cash). They have a few years of optionality here. 
5. Management is retarded and particularly bad at telling the story of their business as well as Q&amp;A. 

**What hasn't changed**

1. You as a shareholder are not paying interest to hold your position. Shorts are. As a result, shorts eventually have to cover, otherwise they will lose. This is a long game. 
2. They are not a bankruptcy risk. That part of the short thesis is dead.
3. Ryan Cohen (10% stakeholder) wrote a letter earlier to make public he didn't like how mgmt was handling GME. The earnings call did current mgmt no favors. 

At $14/share, that puts GME at \~$900MM market cap - for a company that has **$1BN in revenue in a quarter** at the point where a) covid is dampening retail and b) the absolute end of the console cycle. This is the lowest point of the cycle for a cyclical business. Subtract the net cash position of $200MM and that puts you at $700BN valuation for the 

So, abandon ship if you want - but I think a $4BN+/year business model with no net debt, entering into the beginning of a new console generation, with hawks like RC frothing for a takeover still make this a really interesting opportunity.",1607479002,58,1

4070,potatoandbiscuit,"The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in¬†steep decline.¬†The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to¬†thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its¬†financials.¬†This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could¬†decline, leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements(if any) and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

4207,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Once again, Stimulus Talks are going well. Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.
* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).
* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many ""small"" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.
* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.
* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.
* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.
* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every ""tech"" IPO can be a winner.
* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.
* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to ""only"" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.
* DJI closed down 435 pts to 0.15%, IXIC at +0.50% thanks to AMZN and MSFT, while SPX is at +0.18%. **GME closed 0.00%**. Be on the lookout for stimulus news which should resolve by the end of this week. Market moving numbers tomorrow: housing starts/permits, jobless claims, and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index all at at 8:30 AM ET. Quad Witching this Friday, Dec 18. The last time WSB went-all in on Quad Witching cuz hur dur MMs wont pay out the puts was April earlier this year. It didn't pan out. But turns out we were right eventually but for all the wrong reason. The best kind of correct!",1608152585,91,2

4209,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:


* AAPL aims for upping production on their flagship iPhone by 30% for 1st half of 2021 (based on #s from supliers) while JPMorgan sees 20% upside for them in 2021. Tim Apple gaps up and opens at 2%+ this morning with shares going as high as 4.52% intraday. The stock closed at $127.88, up a beefy 5%, level unseen since earlier this September.
* Meanwhile, the rest of big tech took an initial mini dump this morning while the indexes are solidly green cuz sEcToR roTAtiOn and stimulus hOpE but reversed to close mostly green (except for MSFT cuz hur dur MSFT $200c).
* Earlier today, Pelosi asked for McConnell, Schumer, and McCarthy to a 4pm meeting, while current Congressional plan calls for splitting the $948 billion bill into two parts, a $748b in spending programs that are popular for both parties and the 2nd $160b bill with liability protection and aid to state plus local govt. Stimulus checks are STILL not in current plans (rofl). But don't worry, that public ""small business"" with a few thousand employees (not in same location) will no doubt be able to easily access forgivable PPP loans in the coming weeks!
* Cramer talked about WSB today via a segment on TheStreet and WSB proceed to jizz over itself uncontrollably because one old bald dude talking mildly positive about WSB is *just* like the opposite sex touching our genital. This is what #WINNING in 2020 looks like, bois.
* Chinese EV ADR/ADS jump bigly today thanks to who the fuck knows why, with XPEV at intraday high of 7.82%, NIO at 6.1%, LI at almost 5%, and KN-DI at 3%. The EV meme stocks all closed in positive territory despite pulling back from initial highs.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR pulled back 2.97%, continuing in current channel while WSB triples down because ThIS iS a $50 sToNk. DBX, a new play by select WSBer ended the day red but don't worry, an acquisition news is just around the corner before your 12/18s expire worthless. Finally, GME is up 8.88%, likely buoyant by today's NPD report showing 35% increase in YoY November gaming spending thanks to the new gen console cycle release.
* The Dow closed up more than 338 pts to 1.13%, Nasdaq up 155 pts to 1.25%, and S&amp;P up 47 pts to 1.29%. Will stimulus arrive? As Pelosi said by EOD: ""We'll see.""
* Tons of market moving events tomorrow: 8:30 AM retail sales, 9:45 AM PMI, business inventories and housing market index at 10:00 AM, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and finally Jpow speaks tomorrow at 2:30 PM ET after FOMC release at 2:00 PM.

4305,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Congress finally passed the stimulus bill and the Internet proceed to meme the $600 stimulus check becauase let's face it, its a fairly peasant amount given context of situation. Package includes bailout for airlines, new round of PPP ""loans"" and more. Market reacts muted to the passing of the pRiCe iN bill tho QQQ traded green for most of the day (after a quick trip to red town before noon), thanks mostly to AAPL. What would we do without Tim Apple honestly?
* WSB GME gang has collectively nutted today, at least, for those who have diamond handed and/or load-up even more long position after the ER dump. The fabled GME squeeze may be happening in earnest as shares of the gaming retailer shot up as high as 26% during intraday high to $20 without any real additional news beyond Cohen adding to his position (revealed in a filing yesterday). As long as your entry and expiry wasn't beyond retarded, you should be making decent money on GME today. Popular expiry includes calls after April given that'll bake in the much touted Q4 ER period where new console cycle sale numbers will be revealed. WSB eagerly awaits for GME call bro to post his next update. Back of envelop math should have our bro back up about 800k at the very least. GME close the day up 25% to $19.46.
* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.
* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer ""tech/internet"" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.
* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.
* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20
* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.
* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.
* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.
* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET. No interesting ER this week tho Paychex does report BMO on Wednesday morning.

4314,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.

4367,beefstake,"Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.",1608413558,21,0

Furiously jerking their 2 inch boomer cocks to their GME short gainz. They are so close, edging themselves with ""Oh yeah, the next Blockbuster"" and ""Yes baby, brick and mortar go bye-bye."" They even sit in a circle sucking and jerking each other off, double fisting like they're skiing down Mt. Everest with cocks instead of poles. 

Out of nowhere, Ryan Cohen steps in with the most massive and vieniest schlong they've ever seen. He starts eating their lunch and muttering about Cheey for games and they can't do anything because their engorged penises are stuck in eachothers mouths and poop chutes. They attempt to ignorr him and try to keep jerking but they accidentally used hand sanitizer instead of lotion. BAM GME starts rising from the ashes and the retards of WSB are lighting the fires. We brought lighters that we borrowed from our wives boyfriend's and they weren't those shitty clear one. We have motherfucking Bics and torches. 

Melvin is crying and pleading but we are too retarded to understand coherent English. They see giant red dildos on their screens and their buttholes begin to pucker. They dump everything they have at us in an attempt to supress the price but again, we only understand broken english and emojis. We only understand basic visuals and colors. When we see green, we buy. When we see red, we take out another student loan or CC cash advance and we buy more. We are fucking unstoppable. GME skyrockets and they start scrambling to pull dicks out of random orifices, but it's too late. Bears R Fuk.

On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m.

These pieces of üí© tried to destroy a company whose balance sheet had more net cash on it than the entire share price. They deserve everything they get. 

Stop buying shares in margin accounts, you're literally fueling the lendable share supply for these leeches to feed off every time Robinhood or whatever piece of shit broker your retarded asses use. BUY IN A CASH ACCOUNT WITHOUT LENDING ENABLED. I won't go into the details for you, but if you're buying shares in RH with margin enabled it does us no good and hands them the supply they so desperately need.

Short #1 wants to sell an apple but doesn't have any, so they make an agreement with the apple basket to ""borrow"" my apple and sell it, promising to put it back before I need it.

But then the apple basket makes an agreement with Short#2 to loan out my apple (that I don't currently have) and let them sell it.

Now three people have sold my one apple. That's how we get 300% short ratio (GME is at 250%).

Eventually they're going to have to buy back an apple each to give to the lending basket so the basket can cover all the apples it's lent out. But just because they're buying doesn't mean people are selling. If people think the value of apples will go up, they'll hold. Which means Melvin and Co will have to drive to every supermarket, progressively buying more and more expensive apples until they can pay back their debts. **But 300% short rate, means they'll have to buy an apple, give it back to you, then turn around buy that same apple from you again at a higher price, just to give it back to you once more.**

Failure to deliver is when shorts come by and sell an apple without making an agreement with the apple basket. Then when the person they sold the apple to comes to collect they just kind of look at them awkwardly and shrug.

4520,mashev,"&gt;To whom it may concern,  
&gt;  
&gt;This letter serves to bring the SEC‚Äôs attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation‚Äôs (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares. GME‚Äôs failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020\*.\* Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December, the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*  
&gt;  
&gt;12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56  
&gt;  
&gt;12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80  
&gt;  
&gt;12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58  
&gt;  
&gt;12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12  
&gt;  
&gt;12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90  
&gt;  
&gt;12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35  
&gt;  
&gt;12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94  
&gt;  
&gt;12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66  
&gt;  
&gt;12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12  
&gt;  
&gt;12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.

This is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it‚Äôll come next week), and then the conference. 

They also probably don‚Äôt want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum. I suspect 13D filing early next week to jump start the momentum, sales numbers mid-late next week to sustain the momentum, and the the conference the week after that for a complete explosion.",1609539647,20,0

&amp;#x200B;

To whom it may concern,

This letter serves to bring the SEC‚Äôs attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation‚Äôs (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares. **GME‚Äôs failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020**. **Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,** **the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million**. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:

12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56

12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80

12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58

12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12

12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90

12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35

12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94

12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66

12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12

12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31

Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.",1609881941,20,0
4558,TheModeratorWrangler,"I‚Äôm calm. See, the Blockbuster analogy doesn‚Äôt hold water. Blockbuster didn‚Äôt sell physical items, they rented digital content. As an unwise meme once said, ‚Äúwould you download a car?‚Äù

I would in a HEARTBEAT if possible but we aren‚Äôt renting PS5 / Xbox here. Yes, games can be downloaded. But here‚Äôs the catch: physical copies cost just as much as digital downloads for the most part, but digital downloads don‚Äôt come with collectibles and rare goodies. To you? May not seem important, but many gamers prefer owning not just a disk, but the art that comes with it.

Then you have the merch specifically gamer focused. Any fool with Wix can slap graphics on a shirt and sell it. But to see it, feel it, and know you didn‚Äôt expect Tom Nook or Keanu Reeves to be on your merch? That‚Äôs why I went to get a Pikachu plushie for my baby girl and the whole damn store was EMPTY. 

I felt like a terrible father not getting it sooner but I put all my money into $SPY / $AAPL / $GME leaps. My daughter deserves a better future than daddy working for shit wages and never being home.

Point is, $GME is not like Kohl‚Äôs, Macy‚Äôs or Sears where you sell everything to try to get something. It‚Äôs hyper focused on what gamers want and not enough is said about how gamers don‚Äôt just buy games. Most of you here who own Cyberpunk would go nuts seeing a Judy or Panam collectible doll. Or maybe Johnny Silverhand. 

I love shopping at GameStop because a staff that‚Äôs passionate and knowledgeable can tip me off when a rare game comes in and I‚Äôm into nostalgia. Cheap used copies? Preowned consoles to experiment with modding? Releases the same price as downloads that as a Power Member, come with extra goodies?

You don‚Äôt get to the moon without some accidents along the way.

- Local store inventory doesn‚Äôt appear fully tied in.  The GameStop location nearest me has nothing available for same day pickup.  Not one game.  Other locations show inventory available.

A lot of it is simply ""market mechanics"", how the market naturally moves when a big player has to open, close, or roll over a position.

There are tons of examples of this that normies just have no clue about. As someone else mentioned, a big institution that owns bonds might be actively shorting the stock to hedge the bond default risk. Currency markets sometimes have a large effect on some stocks (though likely not GME).

It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS üíé

The Glizzies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these shorts, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about $GME . People who long GME ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate the math in Curt's existential catchphrase ""$1.60 PT,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

4747,UserNameTag,"""Rabid retail investors"" who just saw that they could squeeze 812 million out of short sellers in a single day by reading a subreddit. I'd be worried at this point.  I am no analyst and I don't have contacts in hedgefunds, banks or any other financial institution that can provide me with all the fancy analysis that this guy has, but I can see when something is brewing and has the potential to be game changing.

He did not believe the gains would hold up. If the landscape changed significantly in the last 48 hours, to the short sellers advantage, then I would have agreed with him, but it hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

* GME is still over subscribed by shorts. ( I believe more shorts were added today compared to yesterday)
* The squeeze is still in the news. (Yes Cramer, you should still talk about it)
* The stock is still up 50% from a few days ago
* GME is still on the SHO list (25 days in a row) 

The only major changes since Wednesday are (at least the ones i know about)

* Directors leaving the GME board are selling their stock (good for them)
* Schwab and Fidelity ended margin on GME (still need solid evidence on this, Fidelity didnt pick up my call after 93 minutes on hold)
* SEC 201 Uptick is in effect to next Tuesday

and I dont see these being to any advantage to a short seller, but I could be wrong.

In the 2008 VW squeeze, Porsche owned a shit ton of shares. To be specific according to Reuters;

*Porsche‚Äôs statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct  stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock  options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world‚Äôs  third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.*

If the momentum continues as it has this  week, the tsunami will build up and all it takes, is that Redditor to buy the last shares available before the big institutions become nervous.

There was a poll up a last month that showed redditors sat on close to 5% of the shares, I would almost bet that number is closer to 10 now.

Thats a fucking impressive number for a bunch of *rabid retail investors.*

Listen Lads, 

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, ‚ÄúMoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee‚Äù ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don‚Äôt think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say ‚ÄúGood men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground‚Äù as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat‚ÄîLions and Hyenas. 

These Lions‚Äîthese Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there‚Äôs us‚Äîthe lowly Hyenas‚Äîretail‚Äîthe working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We‚Äôre ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US ‚ÄúDUMB‚Äù MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them ‚ÄúLike, how do you have so much moneyyy?‚Äù 

You know what they say? 

They reply: ‚ÄúHaha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money‚Äù





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He‚Äôs called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He‚Äôs congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He‚Äôs congratulated WSB on the ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù (implying that little thing, was it‚Äîhoping we‚Äôll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they‚Äôre cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They‚Äôre all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I‚Äôve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I‚Äôm throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I‚Äôm fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain‚Äôt so dumb anymore...

As some of you might know, there is a sub which is basically a german WSB ( r/Mauerstrassenwetten ). 

In this sub, the GME hype is just as real as it is here. 
Everyday at 7:30 CET, we buy whatever we can buy. We Hold, we hold as if our lives were to depend on it, and we try to keep the stock as high as possible, until the reinforcement which has the *actual* buying power, comes in at 15:30 CET, or rather 9:30 EST. 

You are the reinforcement. 

You are the buying power. 

You are the allies, this time with the germans on your side, and a mission to accomplish. 

We count on you to buy and hold, we believe in you to buy and hold, and we depend on you to buy and hold. 

*Together*! We can crush the market manipulating, shorting cunts at melvin, shitron and all the other shitshows. 

This is not just a thing between americans. I have seen people from sweden, the netherlands, spain poland and countless other european nations on this sub, salivating to the thought of crushing GME‚Äòs enemys.

4889,wanna_fuck_my_GF,"Copying from u/NrdRage 

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  üßªü§ö running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.  And every time it happens, it creates a higher low.",1611429593,535,0

What you started has now rippled across the entire market. I had 3 acquaintances from school I haven't spoken to in over a decade message me asking about /r/wallstreetbets and GME.  
  
Corporations everywhere are re-assessing risk management because of what you started. This has now become a global phenomenon, and it can all be tracked back to that summer of 2019 when you were laughed off this very board by everyone. I became a believer in July 2020 and even though I don't have a big position in GME, every single day I cheer you on, along with the millions of retards here.  
  
You will be a part of many MBA in Finance courses my dude. The guy who brought down multibillion dollar hedge funds and star hedge fund managers. Hedge funds, despite their deep pockets, will think twice before naked shorting or trying to bankrupt companies in the future.    
  
AND YOU ARE STILL FUCKING IN IT!

4912,Tarsupin,"For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.

10. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

4931,Rake-7613,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people don‚Äôt think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don‚Äôt want credit I just don‚Äôt want the little guy to lose!

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

The year is 2085. I lay on my death bed as my seven great grandchildren, Game, Berry, Deep, Stop, Black, Mars, and Value, visit me one last time. They ask to see how much my 7 GME shares are worth, for the millionth time. I show them. $42,000,000,000.69. I inform my son, who like me exceeds from autism, that I am gifting them a share each. My only request, never fucking sell. u/Deepfuckingvalue , the motherfucking king of all kings, is long gone. Not dead, but traveling universe to universe bringing millions out of poverty and unifying everything in existence. He will return soon, one day. Until then, our universe will continue to hold the line. As my body weakens, I order my ~~wife‚Äôs ex boyfriend~~ butler to bring me my whiskey one last time. After downing the bottle, I close my eyes and smile. I build up the little strength I have left and utter my final words.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî&gt; price goes down ‚Äî&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî&gt; price drops even more ‚Äî&gt; they keep doing that ‚Äî&gt; price drops lower every time ‚Äî&gt; but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is a game of morale, a war of attrition. WALL STREET, MELVIN, HEDGE FUNDS, MARKET MAKERS ARE BETTING ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN. THEY ARE BETTING ON US HAVING PAPER HANDS. THEY ARE SEEING BUY AND HOLD AND THINKING THEY CAN CALL OUR BLUFF

They haven't won. They pulled a dirty, illegal cheap shot, yes. But they wouldn't have done that if they were winning. This ship is still sailing, and will continue to do so as long people HOLD, BUY, and HOLD some more.

Let's not push this victim narrative, let's not allow law suits, angry tweets, and other stocks to distract us. Doing so sews a subconscious sentiment that we have already lost. They want us to take our eye off the ball.

THEY WANT US TO TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE BALL. GME IS THE BALL. BUY IT AND HOLD IT. END OF STORY.

They are literally borrowing from the rest of the market to cover losses or try to profit from GME.

They basically made all people with shares in the index lose money and use that money to cover their loss from GME.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States‚Äô foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve what‚Äôs left of the American democracy.‚Äù

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON. WE LIKE THE STOCK

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is üíéüôå ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we üíéüôå , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

¬∑They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

¬∑$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

¬∑Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your üßª üôå is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

Gamestops really interesting because as a business it's been slowly failing for years and it's stock price reflected a very bearish outlook but fundamentally the business has the cash money to survive for ages and there's a concerted effort to turn it around (rather than just sleepwalk it into the ground). If the stock price holds over 12 through this sell off there's a very really possibility that the stock will rebound to 15+ (just look at the peaks and troughs recently) in the coming weeks and then Q4 earnings could see them posting actually positive EPS and if GME is still a 'meme stonk' at that point it could pop off bigly off the back of that. I don't envisage a crazy short squeeze taking it to 5 batrillion $$$ but there's absolutely no reason that this stock can't go to 30+ just based on its revenue streams - if they can convince the market and consumers that they have a future in the digital space as well as a viable merch/niche brick and mortar operation.",1607468565,21,0

Nobody thought 3Q earnings were going to be positive (or up from last year when COD was released in 3Q as opposed to this year when it came out in 4Q) but they beat the earnings estimates, significantly reduced costs, and are clearly listening to Cohen and pushing hard away from brick and mortar to having a bigger online presence.

The shelf offering is not great for people hoping for the short squeeze, assuming they take advantage of it, but $100m is not a huge amount of share dilution. Even if they used all of it, the short interest would still be at unprecedented levels. 

I am a strong believer in cutting my losses when necessary but I'm buying this dip.

GameStop apparently can't tell which orders were placed in store and which were with the backdoor link.

It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Companies like Steam, owned by the **Valve**, jumped into the web-based world by selling games entirely online. With its first-mover advantage, the company now commands [75% of the world‚Äôs PC games distribution](https://comparecamp.com/steam-statistics.).

GameStop, on the other hand, has been comfortable living in the past. **In 2013, the company s**[**uccessfully lobbied**](https://www.justpushstart.com/2013/06/gamestop-played-a-role-in-microsoft-reversing-drm-on-xbox-one/) **Microsoft (NASDAQ:**[**MSFT**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/)**) to ship its new Xbox One consoles with disc drives, prolonging the life of the used games business**. And in 2020, GME boldly announced a [multi-year strategic relationship](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft) with Microsoft that didn‚Äôt involve game distribution at all. Instead, a careful reader would have realized the partnership involved upgrading GameStop‚Äôs back-end to run Dynamics 365, Microsoft‚Äôs suite of cloud-based business services.

**Finally, you could simply sit back and watch GameStop burn.** While my heart goes out to the thousands of retail workers who will inevitably lose their jobs, my sympathy only goes so far up the food chain; GameStop‚Äôs top brass walked away with [$35.2 million in compensation last year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520120938/d878410ddefc14a.htm#toc878410_21), even as the company‚Äôs business model was collapsing.",1607991308,8,0

Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.
* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).
* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many ""small"" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.
* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.
* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.
* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.
* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every ""tech"" IPO can be a winner.
* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.
* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to ""only"" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.
* DJI closed down 435 pts to 0.15%, IXIC at +0.50% thanks to AMZN and MSFT, while SPX is at +0.18%. **GME closed 0.00%**. Be on the lookout for stimulus news which should resolve by the end of this week. Market moving numbers tomorrow: housing starts/permits, jobless claims, and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index all at at 8:30 AM ET. Quad Witching this Friday, Dec 18. The last time WSB went-all in on Quad Witching cuz hur dur MMs wont pay out the puts was April earlier this year. It didn't pan out. But turns out we were right eventually but for all the wrong reason. The best kind of correct!",1608152585,91,2
5504,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:


* AAPL aims for upping production on their flagship iPhone by 30% for 1st half of 2021 (based on #s from supliers) while JPMorgan sees 20% upside for them in 2021. Tim Apple gaps up and opens at 2%+ this morning with shares going as high as 4.52% intraday. The stock closed at $127.88, up a beefy 5%, level unseen since earlier this September.
* Meanwhile, the rest of big tech took an initial mini dump this morning while the indexes are solidly green cuz sEcToR roTAtiOn and stimulus hOpE but reversed to close mostly green (except for MSFT cuz hur dur MSFT $200c).
* Earlier today, Pelosi asked for McConnell, Schumer, and McCarthy to a 4pm meeting, while current Congressional plan calls for splitting the $948 billion bill into two parts, a $748b in spending programs that are popular for both parties and the 2nd $160b bill with liability protection and aid to state plus local govt. Stimulus checks are STILL not in current plans (rofl). But don't worry, that public ""small business"" with a few thousand employees (not in same location) will no doubt be able to easily access forgivable PPP loans in the coming weeks!
* Cramer talked about WSB today via a segment on TheStreet and WSB proceed to jizz over itself uncontrollably because one old bald dude talking mildly positive about WSB is *just* like the opposite sex touching our genital. This is what #WINNING in 2020 looks like, bois.
* Chinese EV ADR/ADS jump bigly today thanks to who the fuck knows why, with XPEV at intraday high of 7.82%, NIO at 6.1%, LI at almost 5%, and KN-DI at 3%. The EV meme stocks all closed in positive territory despite pulling back from initial highs.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR pulled back 2.97%, continuing in current channel while WSB triples down because ThIS iS a $50 sToNk. DBX, a new play by select WSBer ended the day red but don't worry, an acquisition news is just around the corner before your 12/18s expire worthless. Finally, GME is up 8.88%, likely buoyant by today's NPD report showing 35% increase in YoY November gaming spending thanks to the new gen console cycle release.
* The Dow closed up more than 338 pts to 1.13%, Nasdaq up 155 pts to 1.25%, and S&amp;P up 47 pts to 1.29%. Will stimulus arrive? As Pelosi said by EOD: ""We'll see.""
* Tons of market moving events tomorrow: 8:30 AM retail sales, 9:45 AM PMI, business inventories and housing market index at 10:00 AM, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and finally Jpow speaks tomorrow at 2:30 PM ET after FOMC release at 2:00 PM. Jpow can be as dovish as he wants but without stimulus this market likely has only so much more leg to go in the near term.",1608066999,82,0

5623,beefstake,"Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.",1608413558,21,0

On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m.

THAT MAKES SHORT/FLOAT RATIO 2, NOT FUCKING 12.

The stock went up 500% and it could've possibly gone EVEN HIGHER but Porsche decided to sell 5% of VW's stock so shorts could cover.

* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.
* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer ""tech/internet"" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.
* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.
* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20
* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.
* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.
* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.
* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET. No interesting ER this week tho Paychex does report BMO on Wednesday morning.

5706,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.

The board of directors collectively shat their pants Q3 earnings over it, threatening to issue 100 million dollars worth of new shares. Not 100 million shares, 100 million dollars worth of shares. 

They were trying to prevent Cohen from doing a Hostile  takeover. 

Today, Cohen bought up to 12.9 percent of the company and filed with the SEC. He owns 9,001,000 shares. 9,001,000/.129 means GME has 69,775,194 shares total. For 9,001,000 to be less than 10 percent, GME would need 90,010,000 shares. That means they would need to issue over 20 million shares. 

GME would have to be less than 5 bucks a share for them to be able to issue 100 million dollars worth of shares and successfully fend off Cohen. 

That's impossible, so they aren't going to issue shares. It wouldn't do anything but piss everyone off more and make it even easier for Cohen to fire them, while making them poorer. 

If they are that fucktarded or spiteful for whatever reason, the stock short term dips, we all buy more like flies on shit, Cohen takes over and fires them all, then we moon. 

Tl;dr:

5825,whatisliquidity,"&gt;This is why their Microsoft deal was so important, when gamestop sells new xbox's it gets a share what that console downloads. Microsoft needs to sell as many consoles as it can for their own success, they don't have a network of physical stores or a desire to sell direct to customers.

I think you're overvaluing their Microsoft deal. It essentially amounts to them using Microsoft hardware and software in exchange for a small kickback. Microsoft does have physical stores and has no issues dealing with retail but lacks the desire for that infrastructure especially when they can go direct to digital at less then a 100th of cost.

&gt;This was game changing, the surge in share price after this announcement reflects that.

The surge represented squeeze interest being bought and a potential pivot to the 21st century. Cohen is a much bigger catalyst. 

&gt;Now Sony and Nintendo haven't ruled out a similar deal, and dealing with all retailers in the same way will protect all their collective futures, I wouldn't bet on a deal, but making some sort of deal makes a lot of sense for all parties, they need each other.

I agree they're useful for each other but Sony releasing a new gen console without a drive is a wake up call for GME. They'd better pick up the pace of the shorts will win.",1609008807,1,0

As for dropping B&amp;M completely, and it might be my age talking, but Gamestop is a swapshop to me. You went in for two reasons: 1. to sell or swap a thing for another thing and 2. to discover something random in a bin. Unfortunately we have not done a great job of manufactuering 1 or 2 in an online setting and while I think that maybe GME can pioneer 1 algorithms tend to not be able to be written to cover point 2. 

You'll never ""discover"" anything new again. It's kind of like reading Moody's vs. going to WSB; you don't discover new stocks here, not really, instead you just coalesce on other people's discoveries but the question is where do you go to get the frontier news and be a first adopter?

-If you‚Äôre looking for a good idea read. 
-Or if you don‚Äôt think I will go bust tell my why! 

FACTS: 

1. Stimulus Package; market already priced it in and Trump is taking another Dump on it. If he doesn‚Äôt sign it by midnight tonight FUCK!!!

2. GA Senate Run-Off Elections; only a few weeks away and since the Nov elections the market pumped hard with the expectation of a divided Gov‚Äôt (Republican‚Äôs taking the senate).  May still happen but odds aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they did a month ago. 

3. Peaceful Transition of Power; we can all agree Donnie is unhinged. He only plays golf and tweets how the election was rigged and doesn‚Äôt seem he will ever concede.  

4. COVID; all the vaccine news is priced in however infections and fatalities just keep trending upwards.  

5. Regardless if you are a BULL or BEAR think we can all agree the market is fk‚Äôing expensive.  Specially the Russell 2K &amp; NASDAQ. 

- Russell 2000; last week rose above 2000 for the first time ever and is up over 35% just in the last 3 months.  

-NASDAQ; only 200 points from 13K which I think will touch next week. However once it does it will retract as it has done so every time it reaches a new 1K milestone. 10K, 11K, 12K etc. 

No I‚Äôm not a fucking bear but do think too much good news has been priced and the market is looking for any excuse to pull back.  

Solution: VOLATILITY my weapon of choice UVXY however you can pick your fav. 

UVXY PRICE FUN FACTS: 
1. $10.77 Wednesday closing price. 
1A. $10.58 (12/08) 52 WEEK LOW MKT CLOSE.
1B. $10.26 (12/09) 52 WEEK LOW INTRA DAY. 

2. $13.30 (12/21) last week high, this past Monday when the futures took a dump due to the new covid strain.  BTW that was a 21% PUMP which the market later on ignored.  

3. $21.60 (10/30) just to days prior to the presidential election.  
3A. UVXY has lost over 50% of it‚Äôs value since the last election.  

4. OPTION IV &amp; PUMP: 
4A. Feb 19th $10 CALLS over 150% current price $270 
4B. Same CALL (12/21 from 10am to 10:45am) $890.  Held 10 calls sold 5. 

Wednesday just before market closed laid over $50K across a number of strike prices and expirations.   

Nothing is a guarantee however I would much rather bet on this vs any of the exhausted stonks.   I don‚Äôt doubt GME, QS, TESLA, PLUG etc etc will continue to pump however on the short term the probability is they need to retract before they keep pumping.   BTW; for me to double the 50K I only need the UVXY to go up to $13.27 (ASK YOURSELF DO YOU THINK WE COULD SEE SOME VOLATILITY IN THE NEXT 2-4 WEEKS?  And even if we don‚Äôt and we get even better news volatility can only lose 2-3% before we reach a new 52 week low.

This is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it‚Äôll come next week), and then the conference. 

They also probably don‚Äôt want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum.

6057,Poodogmillionaire,"Everyone was wondering when they would be able to buy in after it went above $20, worried they wouldn‚Äôt get the chance. Well the answer is NOW. I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn‚Äôt want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we‚Äôve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in‚Äôs by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don‚Äôt let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price.

Be sure to form at least a basic understanding before jumping in with real money, and when you do jump in, start with small option plays.

Shares may decrease in value, but other than the company getting delisted it's improbable that you would lose all of your initial investment.

cult stocks are crazy tbh   üòî

what advantage is there from buying games from GME?

if i want a console or physical games, i can go to AMZN, WMT or BBY (latter two have brick and mortar locations if you're into that sort of thing)

if i want digital games, i can download directly from xbox live, PSN store, steam, etc.

if i want mobile games, i download from my phone

But I think more than that he's been studying companies like Amazon and looking for how to do better. Amazon is amazing at a few things, like free and fast delivery and being a one stop shop for...everything. But Amazon does NOT have great customer service. They also have a real and growing problem with sellers. Sold and shipped by Amazon? Cool, no worries there. Literally any other seller? It could be a Chinese knockoff and there's no way to know.


I think Cohen knows that GME can easily compete in delivery by using retail locations, customer service is his trademark, and he won't allow anyone else to sell on their platform.

IMO he's moving towards PC gaming - that way he can use the relationship with Microsoft (who don't forget are arguably the biggest firm in terms of computing), to create a monster in that area. Don't forget he now follows those 2 PC magazines/ websites

6481,Laughingboy14,"üöÄüöÄüöÄ - GME is going to $100

My only issue is that market cap weighted passive funds tend to not actually buy that much more when market cap goes up. This is because as market cap goes up, share price rises, so index funds automatically balance themselves (I.e. without needing to purchase more). 

Passive funds only really buy more when a) they're open funds that have to deploy more capital b) the company is entered into more indexes.

Listen Lads, 

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, ‚ÄúMoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee‚Äù ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don‚Äôt think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say ‚ÄúGood men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground‚Äù as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat‚ÄîLions and Hyenas. 

These Lions‚Äîthese Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there‚Äôs us‚Äîthe lowly Hyenas‚Äîretail‚Äîthe working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We‚Äôre ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US ‚ÄúDUMB‚Äù MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them ‚ÄúLike, how do you have so much moneyyy?‚Äù 

You know what they say? 

They reply: ‚ÄúHaha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money‚Äù





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He‚Äôs called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He‚Äôs congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He‚Äôs congratulated WSB on the ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù (implying that little thing, was it‚Äîhoping we‚Äôll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they‚Äôre cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They‚Äôre all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I‚Äôve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I‚Äôm throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I‚Äôm fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain‚Äôt so dumb anymore...

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  üßªü§ö running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.

The Double Barrel Boomer Suplex^TM is on the table, we have 2 more days until calls hit, $115 on friday could mean atomic rocket fuel juicier than your husband's girlfriends sweatpants. It's looking alot like we're poised to dramatically exceed this mark, forget the üåö, we're gonna find some üëΩ putang over in andromeda while we sip our tendie cocktail. If this is the case, $1000 is not a meme but the strength of üíéüëê's will determine if more is. 

$1000 would be a victory, it would mean student debts payed, downpayments placed, future investments made, luxuries enjoyed and burdens lightened. We are owed this and more after all these leeches have done to ensure we are kept under their boots. They use the media to vilify us because we are crawling our way out, we, the lowly retail trader and are beating them at their own game. 

They wanted us out, they tried to scare us away, they've changed the rules, manipulated the pieces *supposedly* but we are üíéüëê, unphased by the dips!

They know they cant stop us now, the only hope left for them is us letting up before we realize the full value of our holdings. $1000 would change alot of lives, but if you've come to beleive in GME's future prospects and the strength of üíéüëê's you know this is not it's full value. The demand is available for anyone to see, if you want to supply below the curve that's on you but you'll only be helping the people whod see you drown under the rising tide. 

You want to see this system change? you want a better future? You want your children to succeed? Do you wana build a real trickle down economy? Then get your üíéüëê's fucking ready and show these üåàüêª's you know what you're fucking worth!

6925,Rake-7613,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to ‚Äútap‚Äù down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it‚Äôs only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I‚Äôve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It‚Äôs a classic short move.

If you don‚Äôt think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren‚Äôt calling in favors like this right now you‚Äôre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It‚Äôs only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There‚Äôs no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people don‚Äôt think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don‚Äôt want credit I just don‚Äôt want the little guy to lose!

6928,urnewfamousceleb,"30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî&gt; price goes down ‚Äî&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî&gt; price drops even more ‚Äî&gt; they keep doing that ‚Äî&gt; price drops lower every time ‚Äî&gt; but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is a game of morale, a war of attrition. WALL STREET, MELVIN, HEDGE FUNDS, MARKET MAKERS ARE BETTING ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN. THEY ARE BETTING ON US HAVING PAPER HANDS. THEY ARE SEEING BUY AND HOLD AND THINKING THEY CAN CALL OUR BLUFF

They haven't won. They pulled a dirty, illegal cheap shot, yes. But they wouldn't have done that if they were winning. This ship is still sailing, and will continue to do so as long people HOLD, BUY, and HOLD some more.

Let's not push this victim narrative, let's not allow law suits, angry tweets, and other stocks to distract us. Doing so sews a subconscious sentiment that we have already lost. They want us to take our eye off the ball.

THEY WANT US TO TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE BALL. GME IS THE BALL. BUY IT AND HOLD IT. END OF STORY.

https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:

‚ÄúRobinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his company‚Äôs motto of ‚Äúdemocratizing finance for all‚Äù by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States‚Äô foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve what‚Äôs left of the American democracy.‚Äù

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

I don‚Äôt have enough karma for a regular post so I have to go for a comment. Please read this, it may not be the first time you‚Äôre seeing it but I am sending it to reach as many as I can.

The events that have occurred are far more important than any of us truly realise.

We have successfully displayed the illegal market manipulation that the corporations will go to in order to prevent losses.

This is a blatant act of corruption and if not handled correctly will develop into civil unrest. When studying history (at some point we‚Äôve all read history), we understand that pivotal moments are caused by sudden events, as well as an innumerable amount of underlying tensions.

What is happening this week has shown a class issue unlike that which we have seen since 2008. Rather than accepting our circumstance however, this time we have taken action. This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in.

Why should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals? Our response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around.

There is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. WE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society.

While we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings.

The world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this ‚Äòwork culture‚Äô that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.

What then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable.

We are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it.

Hold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. The world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over.

War is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play.

Ignore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your üíé üôå I am not an investment manager, I am but a humble dumbass who really likes this stock üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1611926278,3555,21

You don't know that. Nobody has extra color on RC investments. If you do, please provide the source.

&gt; If the GME board doesn't do what RC's investment firm wants in his letter, which they won't, he'll simply drop his stake in the company.

If GME board doesn't do what RC's investment firms wants, the shareholders will fire the board in favor of RC as CEO.

This is also bearish on AAPL and MSFT... you sure the data isn't inverted?

No of course not. They're just ignorant to it.

7594,CPTHubbard," I posted this over at stocktwits but this thread is relevant for this post too. 

To start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you‚Äôre boarding a rocket).  I'm holding the all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I‚Äôll know pretty soon.  

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen‚Äôs Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that‚Äôs early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you‚Äôre right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the ‚ÄúChewy-fication‚Äù of GameStop ‚Äì efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn‚Äôt like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn‚Äôt like Sherman‚Äôs focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he‚Äôs made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He‚Äôs saying: Don‚Äôt you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn‚Äôt do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman‚Äôs fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs got the eye of the tiger, he‚Äôs still in that young and crushing it phase. He‚Äôs got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he‚Äôs going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He‚Äôs watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company‚Äîthe moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he‚Äôs going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn‚Äôt know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen‚Äôs attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It‚Äôs go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call ‚Äì one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it‚Äôs a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you‚Äôre out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?

Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don‚Äôt Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It‚Äôs almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I‚Äôm guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman‚Äôs incentives ‚Äì financial, ego ‚Äì point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn‚Äôt take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that‚Äôs coming to him. But even though I‚Äôd jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I‚Äôm guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren‚Äôt hard see here.  We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.

Instead, wait for the earnings dump and pile in on calls  when they‚Äôre cheap to stop the MMs from being able to get out of their positions.

Then we can create a really vicious squeeze",1607450547,12,0

&gt;How does it work? Lets say a new X Box X costs $499, the typical margin is around 10% so that is $50. However, what if a customer takes a monthly package such as the All Access package and doesn‚Äôt pay up front for the console and can access games from the cloud : https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access#findaretailer that is $35 per month. So that is estimated to be a 10% rev share with GameStop at $3.5 per month which will be $84 margin over 2 years instead of a one off of $49. When you start considering $25bn or $30bn of total sales over a console cycle that becomes really significant. 5 million XBox X passes could be $210mn of pure margin per year for 2 years.

It could be a multitude of reasons why they are closing however. Anecdotal reply, my city has a population of 200k, we have 3 Gamestops. All spread out, all by different major hubs/shopping centers, none of them have closed through this closure, which makes me assume that the 3 stores we have are doing well, all things considered. Given the opportunity to run a large B&amp;M, cutting expenses and liabilities is a long term, good idea.
Secondly, inventory volume of PS5/XBsX/XBsS. This is the unknown. How does Sony and Microsoft distribute to each store? Is it a set amount, and then the retailer distributes to the location? Or is it ""each store open gets 5 consoles per shipment.""if its the latter, then its not a good decision, if it the prior example, which is the example I would put money on. Then that just means each store gets more inventory, thus creating more excitement at one store, drawing a larger crowd to buy even more knick-knacks from gme.",1607872302,1,0

PS5 won't be far behind if they don't already have something like this. The industry is moving to the monthly subscriber model and all games are purchased digitally now. You can even gift people digital games in the Microsoft store. GME was a brick and mortar distributor and existed to help fill a gap that doesn't exist anymore. 

They literally bring no value to the market. Guaranteed to crumble into a niche retro gaming website. You are all fucking stupid.",1607874559,1,0

GME is great if you're theta gang. Buy commons, sell CC against them. Generate huge returns p.a with little risk considering it's trading at such a low valuation right now.

Note that GameStop does not have to beat Amazon at all (like many here think) to blast off to the moon. The company is insanely undervalued in terms of market cap, it just has to stay afloat (which is almost guaranteed given their financials and huge boost from the concole cycle) and find it's own niche in this huge gaming market.

People mistakenly assume two things:

1) **Everyone is buying digital:** not really true. Tons of people have crappy internet, consoles have very limited storage. And sometimes folks like to own something physical (myself included) - I still buy paper books despite having 4 devices to read from (Kindle is one of them).

Also, this point is even less relevant considering the fact of digital sales revenue sharing with Microsoft and rumors of similar agreements with Sony.

2). **GameStop only sells games on CDs / Will always sell CDs.** Haven't been true for a while, and lots of new directions they can take it to; gaming equipment, at the very least. Think Chewy for gaming (this is where our boy Ryan Cohen comes in)

On top of that sprinkle some insanely huge short interest (128%) playing as an insane upwards pushing force and you get a risky bet but with an insane reward potential.

Also, just a sidenote: a company with absolutely no revenue that makes EV renders and rolls trucks downhill has 6.6x market cap of GME, let that sink in.",1608376277,2,0

If it keeps rising they'll eventually be margin called and forced to double down or close their position. If they close their position it increases GME stock price and we get a positive feedback cycle of shorters closing positions and hopefully the Volkswagen infinity squeeze,1608402281,33,0
8116,_MN_Fun_,"Price targets are all just fantasy. It‚Äôs not the same as VW, could be better, could be worse. Everyone has the facts thanks to the DD here. You are basically in or out to find out. Everyone, bulls, bears, big positions, small positions, all agree, there needs to be a shift of some sort to adapt and change the story of GME. That‚Äôs when we will find out.",1608413301,27,0
8117,beefstake,"Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.",1608413558,21,0

On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m. The feed backloop exists, and its just going to take one major positive catalyst to set it all off, in my opinion.",1608413416,19,0

GME has a concentrated short position (BoA, Melvin) against a large number of longs.  1 to 1 short to float ratio.

There definitely are long term shorts who are in it for the goose egg but that's not all of them. Some got in because they thought COVID was going to end GME. As it becomes more clear that's not going to happen you can expect more covering.

When Q4 comes in at +30% yoy you can expect more and more covering as the reality of GME having a lot of time to pivot sets in. If they make even more progress on Omnichannel (it just means online sales guys, that's all) then expect the floodgates of covering to open. 

If GME is doing well enough to threaten to reinstate its dividend that can also get some shorts to capitulate. The time horizon for a short gets dramatically compressed if they have to pay a dividend too. It would also be a display of confidence by the board.

I've said it before, I've never seen a better setup for tendies in my entire life. Short positions are about to get hammered again and again by good news.

Lastly, if you're inclined to buy or to yolo, no need to rush. There will be down days or down weeks. The ER may have been the best entry but maybe not, stand ready to buy the dips.

I have a calendar spread covered strangle 1/2022 and 1/2023 expiry. -30C and -5P. Premiums stupid high thanks to GME meme stock status, brought my cost basis down to $7.50 when purchased @ $12.72.

Basically, as long as we stay above $7.50 I'm a very happy camper.

But, the play here is the turnaround. I'd just pull this out my ass: gaming hardware, equipments and accessories, consoles once every few years, cybersport involvement, selling merchandise, action figures, collectibles and shit. Not to mention revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft (confirmed) and Sony (rumored). Basically, if the company manages to find a way to stay relevant in any sense, to capture just a teeny-tiny part of this enormous and rapidly growing market - we'd have a 10x bagger on our hands.


The sweetest thing is they are perfectly positioned to make this change - paying back their debts, strong financials (especially so for a retailer during covid). I just can't see how can they go bankrupt for at least a few more years sans something catastrophic happening. I see them being on a right track - closing underperforming &amp; inefficient stores, getting that deal with Microsoft, trying to remake their app and website (they've just recently started offering same-day delivery with DoorDash)

You are judging the company by your anecdotal gaming experience. The thing is, despite all the hate they get from hardcore gamers, they consistently make revenue multiples of their market cap. Most of GME bears I see assume that the company has to be the next hot thing, like Chewy, or Sony, or Steam or smth like Amazon. It does not - it may develop that way, it may not, but just staying afloat and being barely profitable is enough for the stock to rise significantly - check out their revenue and market cap, and compare to their competitors.

8214,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.

8242,telperiontree,"So, you aren't getting it. As long as Cohen owns 10% or more of the company - 10% or more of the stock - he can do a takeover. Before today, he owned 9% of the company. The board of directors collectively shat their pants Q3 earnings over it, threatening to issue 100 million dollars worth of new shares. Not 100 million shares, 100 million dollars worth of shares. 

They were trying to prevent Cohen from doing a Hostile  takeover. 

Today, Cohen bought up to 12.9 percent of the company and filed with the SEC. He owns 9,001,000 shares. 9,001,000/.129 means GME has 69,775,194 shares total. For 9,001,000 to be less than 10 percent, GME would need 90,010,000 shares. That means they would need to issue over 20 million shares. 

GME would have to be less than 5 bucks a share for them to be able to issue 100 million dollars worth of shares and successfully fend off Cohen. 

That's impossible, so they aren't going to issue shares. It wouldn't do anything but piss everyone off more and make it even easier for Cohen to fire them, while making them poorer. 

If they are that fucktarded or spiteful for whatever reason, the stock short term dips, we all buy more like flies on shit, Cohen takes over and fires them all, then we moon.

Cohen taking over = moon
It's now impossible for them to prevent him from taking over

8458,Anonymous_Stork,"What I remember : 
 - there are super bullish markets where everyone is making money with meme stocks and it feels like nothing can do down, and there are bearish markets where everyone is super depressed. Both eventually end and sometimes people get wiped because of that
 - pick good stocks that basically you can buy and never check their value again for 10 years and still sleep like a baby (ideally, stocks that go for less than the value of the assets)
 - dont get cocky and try to time the market, but you should buy stocks that are cheap at the moment
 - any move that is not 100% thought through is speculation. You should only speculate a tiny portion of your portfolio and separate that from your investments
 - do between 25% stocks / 75% bonds and 25% bonds / 75% stocks

8514,whatisliquidity,"&gt;This is why their Microsoft deal was so important, when gamestop sells new xbox's it gets a share what that console downloads. Microsoft needs to sell as many consoles as it can for their own success, they don't have a network of physical stores or a desire to sell direct to customers.

I think you're overvaluing their Microsoft deal. It essentially amounts to them using Microsoft hardware and software in exchange for a small kickback. Microsoft does have physical stores and has no issues dealing with retail but lacks the desire for that infrastructure especially when they can go direct to digital at less then a 100th of cost.

&gt;This was game changing, the surge in share price after this announcement reflects that.

The surge represented squeeze interest being bought and a potential pivot to the 21st century. Cohen is a much bigger catalyst. 

&gt;Now Sony and Nintendo haven't ruled out a similar deal, and dealing with all retailers in the same way will protect all their collective futures, I wouldn't bet on a deal, but making some sort of deal makes a lot of sense for all parties, they need each other.

I agree they're useful for each other but Sony releasing a new gen console without a drive is a wake up call for GME. They'd better pick up the pace of the shorts will win.",1609008807,1,0

You went in for two reasons: 1. to sell or swap a thing for another thing and 2. to discover something random in a bin. Unfortunately we have not done a great job of manufactuering 1 or 2 in an online setting and while I think that maybe GME can pioneer 1 algorithms tend to not be able to be written to cover point 2. 

You'll never ""discover"" anything new again. It's kind of like reading Moody's vs. going to WSB; you don't discover new stocks here, not really, instead you just coalesce on other people's discoveries but the question is where do you go to get the frontier news and be a first adopter?

-If you‚Äôre looking for a good idea read. 
-Or if you don‚Äôt think I will go bust tell my why! 

FACTS: 

1. Stimulus Package; market already priced it in and Trump is taking another Dump on it. If he doesn‚Äôt sign it by midnight tonight FUCK!!!

2. GA Senate Run-Off Elections; only a few weeks away and since the Nov elections the market pumped hard with the expectation of a divided Gov‚Äôt (Republican‚Äôs taking the senate).  May still happen but odds aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they did a month ago. 

3. Peaceful Transition of Power; we can all agree Donnie is unhinged. He only plays golf and tweets how the election was rigged and doesn‚Äôt seem he will ever concede.  

4. COVID; all the vaccine news is priced in however infections and fatalities just keep trending upwards.  

5. Regardless if you are a BULL or BEAR think we can all agree the market is fk‚Äôing expensive.  Specially the Russell 2K &amp; NASDAQ. 

- Russell 2000; last week rose above 2000 for the first time ever and is up over 35% just in the last 3 months.  

-NASDAQ; only 200 points from 13K which I think will touch next week. However once it does it will retract as it has done so every time it reaches a new 1K milestone. 10K, 11K, 12K etc. 

No I‚Äôm not a fucking bear but do think too much good news has been priced and the market is looking for any excuse to pull back.  

Solution: VOLATILITY my weapon of choice UVXY however you can pick your fav. 

UVXY PRICE FUN FACTS: 
1. $10.77 Wednesday closing price. 
1A. $10.58 (12/08) 52 WEEK LOW MKT CLOSE.
1B. $10.26 (12/09) 52 WEEK LOW INTRA DAY. 

2. $13.30 (12/21) last week high, this past Monday when the futures took a dump due to the new covid strain.  BTW that was a 21% PUMP which the market later on ignored.  

3. $21.60 (10/30) just to days prior to the presidential election.  
3A. UVXY has lost over 50% of it‚Äôs value since the last election.  

4. OPTION IV &amp; PUMP: 
4A. Feb 19th $10 CALLS over 150% current price $270 
4B. Same CALL (12/21 from 10am to 10:45am) $890.  Held 10 calls sold 5. 

Wednesday just before market closed laid over $50K across a number of strike prices and expirations.   

Nothing is a guarantee however I would much rather bet on this vs any of the exhausted stonks.   I don‚Äôt doubt GME, QS, TESLA, PLUG etc etc will continue to pump however on the short term the probability is they need to retract before they keep pumping.   BTW; for me to double the 50K I only need the UVXY to go up to $13.27 (ASK YOURSELF DO YOU THINK WE COULD SEE SOME VOLATILITY IN THE NEXT 2-4 WEEKS?  And even if we don‚Äôt and we get even better news volatility can only lose 2-3% before we reach a new 52 week low.

Your comment is basically assuming that there is one guy who holds all the shares that is telling shorts that the shares aren't for sale, that there is no ask price.

When VW squoze, Porsche held over 42% of outstanding VW shares.  They, alone, had a much higher influence on the price at which shorts could close.

If you enter a collar and the underlying goes downsies, you lose money. Period. 

If you enter a collar and the underlying goes uppies, you make money. Period.

You would call that ""very bearish"" position? You can perform all the stupid ass mental gymnastics that you want to believe that a hedge makes your entire position ""very bearish"" as you put it...but its just false. At no point do you want your underlying to move down in a collar.

8679,NothingTard,"To be honest, I took some small gains from watching you retards pump GME, so I don't have hate for it.

I'm not trying to be associated with dumbasses like you and OverpricedButthole. 

Ever since the retarded ""short squeeze"" bullshit, GMEtards have just been insufferable pricks. And regulars in this subreddit can tell from the aggressive shit talking and ghetto lexicon, (and the fact that they have been outed), that there is an outsider crew at the center of this. 

So yeah, ill buy more calls when GME crashes again to take advantage of the momentum stupidity can create, but for both my beliefs about their future and the negativity of the GME crew, I'm not making any big plays with them.

Every video game will *not* be digital due to data caps and download speeds. 

Being so shorted adds the squeeze potential. GME has been circling the drain for years but *that is no longer the case*. Whoever is stuck in that mindset will lose out. 

If you really don‚Äôt know what changed with GME since Covid hit, you‚Äôve clearly done no research. Ryan Cohen buying in this summer and applying pressure for a modern business model, and then GME following that model and RC buying *more* is a very bullish case for this company to pull out of its multi-year dive. 

The contract with MSFT is hopefully just the beginning. Sony and Nintendo may feel the pressure to make similar deals while GME wants to expand online. There will continue to be physical stores as distribution centers and if hard copies of games are on the decline, there‚Äôs plenty of room in the gaming industry to expand with other products.

8799,SentineL-EX,"I went to grad school to learn how to be a quant. I knew next to nothing about mathematical finance going in but I did a little research just to beef up my application letter (because no school will look favorably on you for telling the truth, ""I want this degree so I can get into a career that pays a lot of money""). The whole program is about pricing options, futures and other derivatives, plus a few courses/seminars that expose you to the kind of people/things you can expect on Wall Street.

I started the program in September 2018, and right around that time I heard PredictIt in the news. This was around the time of Kavanaugh's hearing, and since I thought his chances were good (market gave him a 48% chance right after Christine Ford testified) $20 on him. After Kav gave his own testimony it went to the high 70's and I walked out with $30. I also put $10 on Jair Bolsonaro becoming President of Brazil, which I honestly forget why. Probably read his Wikiquote page. But I held that to expiration and also made some money.

What really set me off was finding out that PI ran a weekly tweet market on Trump tweets (you have to predict, to the nearest 5-10, how many times he would tweet for the week). Figured out an arbitrage strategy (""negative risk"") that due to the mechanics of the site would deposit cold hard cash into your account. Not a glitch, just taking advantage of market inefficiency. Ended up pocketing maybe $25 a week until I had enough of a bank to make directional bets. If you follow Donnie long enough you start to pick up on patterns and can usually make an educated guess on where the winning bracket will be. I even wrote a paper exploring some strategies as my master's thesis (one strategy survived the test of time; the rest fell apart pretty quickly a few months after I published the paper).

In the meantime I saw a PI reference on WSB and I was hooked. This was one of the first posts I remember seeing on this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8s08ap/step_4_buy_stock_step_5_what_is_the_stock_market/. Slowly I went from being scared of investing my 1k in the middle of that late 2018 downturn to screwing around with two-figure options (OTM GE put iirc) to getting more and more ballsy. 

Fast forward to now and I have a six-figure sum across two portfolios - my buy and hold is full of 3x funds, still based around the strategy I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce7f4e/the_wsb_guide_to_index_funds_a_buy_and_hold/, and I dedicate 5-10% of my Robinhood funds on fucking around with options. Currently riding the PLTR/GME rockets. Made out like a bandit in March because I listened to Mister Metokur and he was full on panic mode about the coronavirus January/February. Rode puts all the way down and sold them once I realized the green days were a bit too green late March.

YTD up 45% on Robinhood and 51% on M1. Whenever I think that's a lot I look at the gain porn on here and realize that there are some places where even I'm a conservative investor. WSB made me a lot richer and the bantz on here made me a lot happier. Thanks frens",1609105756,3,0

Your post assumes that a short squeeze can happen only under one condition: lack of liquidity. You say that 15 million of shares are traded every day of GME which means liquidity is just fine and they have nothing to worry about. But those may be the same shares circulating over and over, while Ryan, Sherman (since he can't sell his shares due to Ryan's stake) and us and possibly other players are bagholding. Overall, we have to have like 30% of shares combined.

 15m shares a day, 25% of the stock, is traded every day. Okay, great. But literally on any good news at all, GME will go up. A million scenarios can be favorable to GME, while only one benefits üåàüêª: that GME will go bankrupt. Speaking of probability, on any good news, people will start to catch on, people will get in on the hype = less shares in circulation. The cycle will repeat. How are shorts supposed to cover 130%, paying daily interest, when 30% of shares and potentially more in the future are locked off, forever? Like 50%, 75% of shares at most can exchange hands on any given day but they can't cover everything since a large portion of people will just refuse to sell. Liquidity only goes so far without the price pumping.

Second of all, a short squeeze like VW is very unlikely to happen again, short of a miracle event. Why? Because people expect it. Maybe retail will buy into something that's likely to short squeeze but I doubt an institution doesn't remember the burn of VW. They will avoid it at all costs. By this logic, a short squeeze can only happen under different market conditions.


You sound intelligent, you analyse the market like a professional. Which means, hedge funds out there are staking it all on similar logic. They short GME because liquidity is high, so surely, for you guys, it can't be a repeat of VW. That's the gotcha. That's why nobody is panicking yet. And that's why GME actually has a chance to squeeze.


Anyway why do I bother typing this out though if noone on this sub can read

8957,Poodogmillionaire,"Everyone was wondering when they would be able to buy in after it went above $20, worried they wouldn‚Äôt get the chance. Well the answer is NOW. I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn‚Äôt want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we‚Äôve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in‚Äôs by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don‚Äôt let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price.
